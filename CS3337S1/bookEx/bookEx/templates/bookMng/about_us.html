    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to the Book Exchange — a full-stack web application developed by students who are passionate about creating a practical solution to a common problem: the high cost and inaccessibility of textbooks. This platform allows students to browse, search, and share books in a way that’s simple, fast, and student-friendly.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our project was created as part of a semester-long software engineering course, where we collaborated to design and implement core features such as searching for books, posting listings, and managing user favorites. We also introduced custom enhancements like book ratings, user comments, and a clean, responsive interface using Django, HTML, and CSS.
    </p>

    <p>
        Throughout the development process, we communicated daily, divided responsibilities, and supported each other in learning new tools and solving technical challenges. We followed Django’s Model-Template-View (MTV) architecture to build a scalable and maintainable system and used GitHub for version control and collaboration.
